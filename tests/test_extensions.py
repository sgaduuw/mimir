"""SQLite pragma contract for `mimir.extensions`.

The `connect` listener at `mimir/extensions.py` sets four pragmas on
every connection — WAL journaling, NORMAL sync, FK enforcement, and
the configured `busy_timeout`. These are load-bearing:

- WAL is what makes readers non-blocking during ingest writes.
- `foreign_keys=ON` is what makes the `ON DELETE SET NULL` /
  `ON DELETE CASCADE` clauses on `articles.canonical_inbox_id` and
  `article_lists` actually fire.
- `busy_timeout` is what rides out scheduler write windows; without
  it (the SQLite default is 0) transient contention surfaces as
  hard 500s.

A regression that broke the listener wiring (e.g. an SQLAlchemy
2.x update that changed `event.listens_for` semantics, or someone
swapping the engine for a fresh one without re-registering) would
only show up on a production lock incident. These tests assert the
contract directly so the regression surfaces in CI instead.
